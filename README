NOTE:
1. csve is written via Vi using Python
2. csve is mainly used for evolving old csv files based on new ones
3. old csv files would be back-up at first
4. core algorithm of csve is called MO - matirx operation
5. all trans*.csv are used for UT
6. all csve*.out are generated by './csve.py -d newDir oldDir'

Thanks,
Dave
